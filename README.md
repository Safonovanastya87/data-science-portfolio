## Methodology

Every project follows a structured ML workflow:
1. Problem definition and data understanding  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature engineering  
5. Model training and validation  
6. Performance evaluation (R¬≤, RMSE, Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.)  
7. Model interpretation and visualization  
8. Conclusions and future work
